# Signify Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Signify** project! Follow this guide to set up the project and start using gesture recognition on your system. Ensure you meet the requirements and have the necessary tools installed before proceeding.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

### Hardware Requirements
- A computer with a functional webcam.
- At least 4 GB of RAM for smooth performance.
- Multi-core processor (recommended for real-time responsiveness).

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/signify.git
cd signify
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
To avoid conflicts with other Python libraries, create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Test the Installation
To verify that the installation is successful, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
The program should launch the webcam feed, and you should see your gestures being recognized.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"ModuleNotFoundError"**: Ensure all dependencies are installed by re-running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Webcam Not Detected**: Check your webcam's connection and permissions in the operating system.
- **Slow Performance**: Close other resource-intensive applications or lower the camera resolution in the code.

## Additional Notes

### Updating Dependencies
If new dependencies are added in future updates, run:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Contribution Setup
If you're contributing to the project:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked version.
3. Set up the environment as described above.
